# Best Simple Chicken Kabob
*Makes enough for 3-4 people*

NOTE:  For best results, use "flat metal" skewers for grilling the kabobs. This will ensure that you can rotate 180 degrees halfway through cooking without the meat slipping right back around to accommodate its center of gravity.

## Ingredients
+ 2 large chicken breasts
+ 2 Tbsp sesame oil
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 2 tsp paprika
+ 1 tsp ground black pepper
***
## Instructions
### Prepare the Chicken and Marinate Overnight
+ Mix the sesame oil, salt, paprika, and ground black pepper in a bowl to make a paste
+ Trim any fat and gristle off the chicken breasts, then cut into cubes, rough ~1-1.5 inches on each side
+ Drop cubes in bowl and mix to evenly coat each chicken cube with the paste
+ Transfer the chicken to a quart sized ziplock bag and allow to marinate overnight
### Grilling the Kabobs
+ Before heating your grill, remove the metal grate and ensure your kabob skewers can be placed such that the meat will be suspended directly over the heat source. (see Youtube video referenced below for a visual)
+ Preheat the grill to ~500F
+ While the grill is heating up, skewer those chicken cubes!
+ When the grill is at temperature, cook the kabobs about 4 mins, rotate 180 degrees, then cook for another 4 mins
+ Remove from grill when chicken reaches an internal temperature of 160 degrees F with a meat thermometer
  + NOTE: the US Health Department recommends a minimum temperature of 165 degrees F to minimize risk of foodborne illnesses
+ Serve immediately, while still hot!
