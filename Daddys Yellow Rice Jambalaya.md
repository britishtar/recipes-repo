# Daddy's Yellow Rice Jambalaya

***
## Ingredients
+ 1/3 package pre-cooked andouille sausage (equal part with chicken)
  + ("Conecuh" brand cajun-style smoked sausage works nicely)
+ 1 large chicken breast
+ ~1 tsp canola oil
+ Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning
+ 3 spoonfuls ghee (clarified butter), can substitute cooking oil of choice
+ 1 cup long-grain white rice
+ 1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
+ 1 green onion stalk, chopped
+ 1/2 large jalapeno (or 1 small), sliced into medallions
+ 1 celery stalk, sliced crosswise into pieces
+ 4 cloves garlic, minced
+ 1 tsp onion powder
+ 1 tsp ground turmeric
+ 2 cups chicken broth

## Instructions

### Prepare the chicken and sausage
+ Cut the chicken breast into bite-size pieces, ~1/2" wide.
+ Sprinkle raw pieces well with Tony Chachere's seasoning.  Ensure an even coating of seasoning all around the pieces.
+ Heat a small amount of canola oil (~1 tsp) in a skillet on medium heat.
+ Pan-fry the chicken pieces in the skillet, turning once or twice, ensuring every piece is cooked through (but not overcooked! We're not making rubber erasers, here!).
+ Remove from heat. Remove the chicken pieces to a separate bowl and set aside.
+ Cut sausage into small bite-sized pieces (medallions, halved or quartered)

### Saute the rice and veggies
+ Plop the ghee (or oil) into the same skillet used for the chicken, place over medium heat.
+ Use a wooden spatula to deglaze the seasoned chicken residue from the skillet.
+ Add the cup of rice to the hot ghee, and gently stir for about 2 minutes.
+ Add in the chopped veggies (bell pepper, green onions, jalapeno, and celery), stir.
+ Stir in the garlic, onion powder, and turmeric.
+ Continue to saute until the rice begins to lightly brown, stirring constantly (don't allow the )

### Simmer, mix, and serve
+ Slowly stir in the chicken broth and bring the mix to a boil.
+ Give one good scrape against the bottom of the skillet to ensure no rice is sticking to the bottom.
+ Reduce head to lowest setting, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes.
+ Stir to fluff the mixture, scrape off any rice stuck to the bottom after the simmer period and stir in.
+ Add in the chicken and sausage pieces, mix well, then cover and heat for an additional 5 minutes.

## References:

+ This recipe was inspired by the jambalaya served at a little creole restaurant in North Charleston called **"Cherie's Speciality Meats"**, that has sadly since closed its doors. I experimented and searched for years for a similar, non-tomato-based jambalaya recipe with no success. Finally, I tried using a plain yellow rice recipe as a base, and added the veggies and meats that I knew were used in the Cherie's recipe. At long last, I once again tasted the delicious blend of flavors that I had been craving for 8 years!
