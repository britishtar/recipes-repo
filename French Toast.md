# French Toast
NOTE: This is really good with leftover fresh baked bread!
***
## Ingredients
+ 6 slices of bread (brioche or challah work well)
+ 1/2 tsp cinnamon
+ 1/4 tsp nutmeg
+ 2 tbsp sugar
+ 2 - 3 eggs
+ 3 tbsp milk
+ 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
***
## Instructions
+ In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar
+ In a larger mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract
+ Whisk in the cinnamon/sugar mixture
+ Heat a large skillet on med/low, and melt a generous pat of butter
+ Dip the bread slices in the egg mixture, allowing each side to soak in some of the mixture
+ Pan fry the soaked slices in the skillet, ensuring the egg is thoroughly cooked
  + *This will require more time for thicker bread slices.*
