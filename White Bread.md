# White Bread (for slicing, sandwiches, etc...)
+ NOTE: Store this bread in an airtight plastic bag to retain moisture.

## Ingredients
#### Yeast Activation
+ 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
+ 1/2 cup lukewarm water
+ 1/2 tsp sugar

#### Bread Dough
+ 19.5 ounces all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
+ 2 tbsp sugar
+ 1 1/4 tsp salt
+ 1 1/4 cup warm water (may not require all)
+ 2 tbsp melted butter

***
## Instructions

### Activate the yeast
+ Use 1/2 cup warm water in a small bowl.
+ Sprinkle yeast on top.
+ Stir in 1/2 tsp sugar.
+ Allow to dissolve and become foamy.

### Mix Ingredients
+ Measure flour into mixing bowl (for stand mixer) and stir in the salt and 2 tbsp sugar with whisk.
+ Make a well in the center, and stir in dissolved yeast, half the water, and butter with a rubber scraper.
+ Add additional water, a little at a time, while stirring, until stiff, shaggy consistency.
+ Use rubber scraper to gather the dough in the center.
+ Cover and allow mixture to "rest" for 30 minutes.

### Kneading
+ Using stand mixer with dough hook, knead the dough on low speed for about 2-5 minutes, until the dough comes together to form a ball.
+ Raise speed 1 level, knead the dough another 12-15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic.
+ Correct consistency as follows:
  + If too sticky, add dusting of flour at a time until desired texture.
  + If too dry, add sprinkle of water at a time until desired texture.
  + Dough should stick to bottom of bowl, but not to sides.
+ Dough should be smooth, a little soft and a little tacky to the touch.

### First Proofing
+ Use rubber scraper to gather the dough in the center.
+ Transfer dough to an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Proof in a warm place until doubled in size (~1 hour).
+ After warm proofing, retard in the refrigerator for ~1 hour or up to 24 hours.
  + *This will make the dough easier to handle during shaping*
+ Prep the loaf plan by greasing with a bit of paper towel and oil, then add ~tbsp flour and "tap" it around the pan to leave a nice even coating of flour sticking to the grease. Dump any remaining flour onto your work surface.

### Shaping
+ Give your work surface a healthy dusting of flour, to ensure the dough will not stick and roll up nicely during shaping.
+ Turn the proofed dough out onto the work surface. Gently press the dough with floured fingers into a flat, elongated oval. The short side should be slightly shorter than the length of the pan.
+ Next, tightly roll up the short side, along the length of the oval.
+ Once the dough is rolled up, pinch the seams to seal it, and tuck in the two sides and pinch these seams as well. Make sure all the seams are on one side (this will be the bottom) and the other side is smooth and seam-free (this will be the top).

### Second Proofing
+ Place dough in the prepared loaf pan, seam side down, and press into the pan. Make sure it’s evenly pressed into the bottom of the pan.
+ Loosely cover the loaf pan with oiled plastic wrap and let it proof again in a warm place, ~45 mins.
  + *NOTE: The top of the dough should rise about 1 inch above the rim of your bread loaf pan (when looking from the side).*
  + *NOTE: To gauge whether the loaf is properly proofed, gently press into the dough with your finger. If the dough is perfectly proofed it will form an indentation. If the dough bounces back without leaving an indentation, it is under-proofed. If the dough collapses, then the dough has over-proofed--re-knead/re-form and proof it again).*
+ Preheat oven to 375°F.

### Baking
+ Place loaf in the middle of the oven, and bake for ~45 minutes.
  + *NOTE: when done, should sound hollow when tapped on top.*
+ Remove the pan from the oven to cool. To prevent sweating, after about 10 minutes, remove the bread from the pan and finish cooling on a wire rack.
+ Optional - brush melted butter on the top while it's hot to add more buttery flavor.
