# Chicken Banh Mi Sandwich
NOTE: This is great with fresh-baked baguettes!
***
## Ingredients

### Carrot Marinade
+ 1/4 cup rice vinegar
+ 2 tbsp water
+ 2 tbsp sugar

### Chicken Marinade
+ 1/3 cup fish sauce
+ 1/3 cup lime juice
+ 2 1/2 tbsp sugar
+ 4 cloves fresh garlic, finely diced
+ 1 tsp salt

### Sandwich
+ 4 large carrots, shredded
  + *NOTE: I use a potato peeler to peel carrot away into shreds*
+ 2 large chicken breasts
+ 1 large cucumber
+ 2 jalapeno chiles
+ Mayonnaise
+ 2 french baguettes

## Instructions

### Pickle the Carrots
+ In a medium saucepan, bring the rice vinegar and water to a boil.
+ Remove from heat, add sugar, and stir until dissolved.
+ Allow to cool, then add in shredded carrots. Be sure to mix around to ensure they all get in contact with the marinade.
+ Marinate in refrigerator for 30+ minutes.

### Marinate and Grill the Chicken
+ Combine fish sauce and lime juice in a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 30 seconds.
+ Mix in sugar and salt until dissolved.  Mix in diced garlic.
+ Put the chicken breasts on a clean, sturdy surface for tenderizing.
+ Cover the chicken with plastic wrap to prevent splatter, and smash the meat flat with a meat tenderizer.
  + *NOTE: Don't be shy with the smashing. This serves three purposes--it makes the meat more tender; it provides for better soaking of the marinade; and it enables more even thermal distribution during grilling. Chicken breasts should be flattened to ~1/2 inch.*
+ Place the tenderized chicken breasts in the marinade and swish around to ensure marinade covers all surface area for both.
+ Marinate in the refrigerator for 20+ minutes.
+ Head a propane or charcoal grill to 500 degrees.
+ When ready, grill chicken for ~2 minutes on each side. Use a meat thermometer to check that internal temperature is at least 155 degrees F.
  + *NOTE: the US Health Department recommends a minimum temperature of 165 degrees F to minimize risk of foodborne illnesses.*
+ Remove from grill and immediately cover with aluminum foil. Meat will continue to cook over the next 10 minutes.
+ Slice chicken breasts crosswise in 1/8-1/4 inch slices for the sandwiches.

### Make the Sandwiches
+ Slice the cucumber and jalapenos into thin medallions.
+ Slice the baguettes lengthwise along major axis (the way it makes sense for sandwiches).
  + (optional) Toast freshly exposed surface.
+ Spread mayonnaise generously on freshly exposed surfaces of bread.
+ Place cucumber and jalapeno medallions on one side of bread.
+ Place chicken breast slices on the other side.
+ Add pickled carrots, and enjoy!
