## Instructions

### Crust
1. Combine dry ingredients (flour, corn meal, sugar, salt, yeast) in a mixing bowl (for stand mixer, if available).  Whisk together by hand using a wire whisk.
2. Check temperature of water and melted butter, ensure it is below 110 degrees F so as not to kill the yeast.  Thoroughly mix water and melted butter into the dry ingredients to form a dough.
3. Knead the dough (in stand mixer using dough hook if possible) for ~5-10 minutes.
4. Grease a large glass bowl for proofing.  Gather the dough together in a ball and place in the greased bowl.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and place in a warm place to proof for ~30-45 mins until doubled in size.
5. Remove dough from bowl and knead by hand, tossing as necessary to cool the dough to room temperature after proofing.  Flatten dough out on a kneading surface into a roughly 12 x 24 in rectangle.
6. Using a flat spatula or rubber scraper, spread softened butter evenly across the entire surface of the rectangle.  This is called "laminating", and will give the crust its flaky, layered texture.
7. Starting with a short edge, roll the dough up into a log (like making cinnamon rolls). "Fold" the log in half or thirds to form a ball, and place back in the glass bowl for a second proofing in the refrigerator. Then begin cooking the sauce.

### Sauce
1. Heat ~2 Tbsp olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add grated onions, salt, oregano, and garlic.  Saute for about 5-10 mins until it just begins to brown.
2. Add entire contents of canned diced tomatoes to the pan (do not drain the tomatoes).  Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a brisk simmer.  Stir frequently and continue to simmer until sauce is reduced--most of the liquid should be boiled off, but not all.  This should take about 20 - 30 minutes.
3. While sauce is reducing, remove dough from refrigerator and begin making the pie.  Try to time it so that the sauce will finish reducing just as you finish making the pie, so that it is hot when you pour it over the toppings--this will heat up the cold cheese and help with making sure the crust gets cooked through.

### Make the Pie
1. Grease a 12 in cast iron skillet. Preheat your oven to 425 degress F.
2. Carefully roll out the dough into a roughly 14 in diameter circle.
3. Flour the surface of the circle so that it won't stick when you fold it in half.  Fold it in half, then flour the exposed underside and fold in half again.  Quickly transfer the folded dough into the greased cast iron skillet, placing the tip of the 90 degree corner in the very center of the skillet.  Unfold the dough and gently press it into the skillet, shaping the pie.  The edges of the crust should come up the side of the skillet and you should be left with a pie that is ~1.5 to 2 inches deep.
  + *NOTE: This technique is called "quartering", see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUJW74ynkBM) for visual instruction.*
4. Slice the mozzarella and line the bottom of the pie with cheese.
5. Layer the pepperoni on top of the cheese, completely covering it.
6. Dump the sliced olives in and spread evenly over the pepperoni layer. Add any other additional toppings you desire.
7. Finally, when the sauce is ready, pour the sauce into the middle of the pie, and use a flat spatula to spread it out from the center and form an even layer on top of the cheese, pepperoni, and black olives.  The sauce should be thick and chunky, with very little liquid.

### Baking
1. Bake the pie on the middle rack for ~15 minutes until the crust is browned. Remove it from the oven, quickly cover the browned crust with tinfoil or a crustsaver, and place it back in the oven, this time on the bottom rack. Bake for an additional 20 minutes.
2. You can check the bottom crust for doneness with an instant-read thermometer.  If it reads > 190 degrees F, you should be good.  The goal is to get a nice crispy brown on the bottom of the crust.
