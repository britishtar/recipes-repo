### Main Dish:

  + About 1/2 of a medium sized pumpkin
  + Can also use a medium size butternut squash
+ 3 tbsp ghee or olive oil
+ 3 tbsp brown sugar

### Yogurt Topping:

+ 1 tsp salt (or to taste)
+ (optional) 1/2 tsp garlic powder
***
## Instructions
+ **Tadka/tomatoes:**
  + Heat the ghee (or oil) in a large saute pan on high heat until it begins to smoke.
  + Reduce heat to medium and add the tumeric, brown sugar, and garlic. Quickly stir to combine the flavors and be careful not to burn.
  + Dump in the chopped tomatoes and stir. Reduce heat to med/low and simmer for ~8 mins until "creamy" texture is achieved.
+ **Steam the pumpkin:**
  + In a medium stockpot with lid, bring the vegetable broth to a boil.
  + Add the pumpkin chunks, reduce heat to medium, and cover.
  + Steam the pumpkin for ~5 mins until "al dente" (not completely cooked through).
+ **Combine tomatoes and pumpkin:**
  + Pour tomato combination evenly over the steaming pumpkin.
  + Cover with lid and continue to steam for ~10 mins until soft and completely cooked, but not mushy.
  + Check/stir every few minutes, add additional broth as necessary to keep veggies from burning/sticking to the bottom of the stockpot.
+ **Yogurt topping:**
  + Mix the yogurt, salt, (and garlic powder if desired) until smooth and creamy. Adjust salt to taste.
+ **Plate:**
  + Line a serving plate with some of the yogurt mixture.
  + When the pumpkin is done cooking, add some to the serving plate (on top of the yogurt lining).
  + Add additional dollops of yogurt mixture to top as desired.
