# Hotdog Buns
NOTE: Requires overnight retarding
***
## Ingredients
+ 17.6 oz (500 g) all-purpose flour
+ 1/2 cup warm milk
+ 1/2 cup warm water
+ 2 tsp dry yeast
+ 1 1/2 tsp salt
+ 1 tbsp sugar
+ 1 egg
+ 2 tbsp oil
***
## Instructions

### Make the dough
+ Mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.
+ Separately whisk together the water, milk, and egg.
+ Combine dry and wet ingredients in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.  Add additional water to attain a fairly wet and sticky consistency.
+ Switch to the dough hook, and knead for 5 minutes.
  + *This may require periodic stopping and re-arrangement of the dough around the hook to ensure continued kneading.*
+ Add the oil, and knead for another ~8 minutes until the dough is shiny, smooth, and tacky to the touch.
  + *You may need to use your hands to "squish in" the oil to prevent the dough from just flopping around in the oil.*

### First Proofing
+ Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover/seal with plastic wrap, and retard in the refrigerator overnight.

### Shape the dough
+ **For hotdog buns:**
  + Divide the dough into 8-12 equal pieces (8 for large buns, 10 for medium, 12 for small)
  + Roll and flatten each piece into a roughly 4" x 6" piece
  + Tightly roll up along the major axis
  + Tuck in each end (to form round ends), and pinch all dough seams to seal
  + You should have a 5" x 1" rounded cylinder
+ **For hamburger buns:**
  + Divide into 8 - 10 equal pieces
  + Roll each piece into a ball with your hands

### Second proofing
+ *NOTE: Before continuing, you can freeze the buns for proofing/baking at a later date, if desired.*
+ Place buns on parchment paper-lined baking sheet, 2" - 3" apart
+ Cover with oiled plastic wrap or damp cloth and proof in a warm place for ~45 mins, until roughly doubled in size
+ Preheat oven to 350 deg F

### Baking
+ Brush the buns with an egg wash (whisked egg)
+ Bake buns until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped (about 25 - 30 mins)
+ Allow to cool on cooling rack to prevent sweating
