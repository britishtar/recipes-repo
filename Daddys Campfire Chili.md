# Daddy's Campfire Chili
NOTES:
+ This is best cooked in a cast iron dutch oven.  You can even do it over a campfire, cowboy style!
+ The chili is even better when it has a day or two for flavors to blend. Consider preparing it the day before and refrigerating overnight (but not in the dutch oven!)
+ Serve with fresh baked jalapeño cornbread!
+ Without the optional ingredients, the chili is savory and delicious, but not spicy, since Daddy has little girls that "don't like the spicy". Mommy and Daddy both like to add smoked chipotle powder to our servings to enhance its already beautiful smokey flavor, and add just a little "kick". Any chili powder can, of course, be added to raise the heat level from mild, to medium, to thermonuclear depending upon your preferred taste.

## Ingredients
+ 1 onion, finely diced
+ 5 strips of smoked bacon, cut in half crosswise to make 10 shorter strips
+ 1 lb. ground beef (use 80/20 for best results!)
+ Liquid smoke
+ Cumin
+ Garlic powder
+ Paprika
+ Salt
+ 1 cup bone broth
+ 1 12 oz. can kidney beans
+ 2 12 oz. can diced tomatoes
+ Chipotle powder (optional)
+ Other chili powder(s) for additional heat (optional)

## Instructions
+ Fry the bacon strips in a dutch oven or pot.  Pull the strips out and set aside when they are tender but not yet crispy.
+ Use the bacon grease to sauté the diced onion, stirring until evenly cooked and translucent.
+ Add ground beef and brown the meat over med/low heat, stirring constantly.
+ Season with cumin, garlic powder, paprika, and salt to taste. It should taste like delicious, savory taco meat.
+ Add in a squirt or two of liquid smoke.
+ Stir in bone broth, bacon, and kidney beans and bring to a simmer.
+ Finally, add in the diced tomatoes (liquid and all).
+ Stir, cover, and reduce to lowest heat setting.
+ Allow flavors to blend together, continuing to simmer over low heat for ~30 mins or up to several hours.
+ When ready to serve, add in chipotle powder, chili powder, cayenne, and/or other optional seasonings to desired heat/spiciness level.
+ Serve with your favorite chili garnish (e.g., shredded cheddar, sliced jalapeno, and a dollop of sour cream!)

+ This one is a complete original, but Daddy has to give credit to his buddy Chris for recommending the bacon, which gives this chili its characteristic smokey taste.
