# French Baguette

Note: Overnight retarding recommended for best results, but can be done on same day.
***
## Ingredients
+ 1/4 cup warm water
+ 1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
+ 16 oz all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
  + about 2 cups
+ 1 1/2 tsp salt
+ 1 1/2 cup cool water (probably not all needed)
***
## Instructions

### Activate the yeast
+ Use 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl.
+ Sprinkle yeast on top.
+ Stir in a dash of sugar
+ Allow to dissolve and become foamy.

### Mix ingredients
+ Measure flour into large bowl and stir in the salt with whisk.
+ Make a well in the center, and stir in dissolved yeast with a rubber scraper.
+ Add cool water, a little at a time, while stirring, until stiff, shaggy consistency.
+ Use rubber scraper to gather the dough in the center.
+ Cover and allow mixture to "rest" for 30 minutes.
+ Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, gently fold it into thirds, turn 90 degrees and fold into thirds again (create a taught surface).

### First proofing
+ Place dough in a large, oiled bowl and cover.
  + For best results, let proof overnight in refigerator (retarding).
  + If baguettes must be baked on same day, allow to proof in warm place until doubled in size (about 1 to 2 hours).

### Shaping
+ **Divide the dough** into:
  + 4 parts for breadstick size loaves.
  + 3 parts for medium size loaves.
  + 2 parts for large loaves.
+ **First Shaping** (optional):
  + Round each piece of dough into a ball by pulling the edges into the center and pressing them together to seal.
  + Allow to rest for 15 to 30 minutes (can be longer in the refrigerator).
+ **Final Shaping**:
  + Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.
  + Turn the dough around, and repeat: fold, then flatten.
  + Roll out each baguette on the work surface.
    + The goal is to elongate and create a tensile surface for the baguette.

### Second proofing
+ Place baguettes on a baking tray or baguette tray lined with parchment paper.
+ Allow to proof in a warm place for 30 to 45 mins, until loaves are doubled in size.
+ During the last ~15 mins of proofing, preheat the oven with skillet as described below.

### Bake
+ Pour 2 cups of water into a cast iron skillet and place on the lowest shelf in oven.
  + *This is critical to get the crusty surface characteristic of baguettes*
+ Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
+ Score the loaves with a serrated knife dipped in water, or lame.
+ Brush surface of loaves with water. (optional)
+ Bake for 15 to 25 minutes until the surface is a dark golden brown.
+ Remove loaves from the oven to cool.
+ Transfer to a cooling rack after 10 minutes to prevent sweating during cooling.
