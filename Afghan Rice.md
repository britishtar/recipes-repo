## Instructions

### Beforehand

### Prepare the base
+ In a dutch oven (oven safe! no plastic handles!), heat 1/4 cup ghee over high heat, stir in salt.
+ Add in the onions and saute until browned (~10 mins), stirring constantly--DO NOT BURN!

### Prepare the topping
+ In a separate skillet, saute the julienned carrots in 1 tbsp of ghee, along with the 1.5 tbsp sugar.
  + Saute until the carrots are 'al dente' (~1 min).
+ Add raisins and almonds, stir several times until flavors are blended, continue to saute ~3 mins.
  + Remove from heat when raisins are plump.
+ Make a pouch out of aluminum foil, and seal up carrot/raisin mixture in the pouch. Set aside until baking step.  

### Boil the rice
+ Boil the rice in 6-7 cups of water until al dente (~5-10 mins)--do not overcook.
+ Strain rice in a colander.

### Combine and bake
+ Add strained al dente rice to the onion mixture in the dutch oven.
+ Add cumin, cardamom, and black pepper. Stir well to blend flavors.
+ Add in the pouch with topping, cover the dutch oven, and bake at 500 deg for ~10 mins, then reduce heat to 250 deg, and continue baking for ~20 mins.
